# Jane Street's etf sf!

Hello People, 

We are Alan Duan and Enrique Segura, and we are the CupCakely team! 

All the code written here was for Jane Street's hackathon, etc sf, on July 16, 2016, in San Francisco, CA. 

It is worth saying that much of the financial algorithms was done by Alan, while I worked on the EMT trading, the bundle trading, and a simple parser.
