# Jane Street's etf sf!

Hello People, 

We are Alan Duan and Enrique Segura, and we are the CupCakely team! 

All the code written here was for Jane Street's hackathon, etc sf, on July 16, 2016, in San Francisco, CA. 

It is worth saying that much of the financial algorithms were developed by Alan, while I worked on the EMT trading, the bundle trading, and a simple parser. 

Should you be thinking of participating in etf, please take notice to the arbitrage logic, as well as pennying's. We found out those to be extremely meaningful. If we had gotten them up and running early in the contest we would have done better. 

Have fun!
